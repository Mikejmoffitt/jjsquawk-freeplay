J. J. Squawkers Free Play patch
===============================

Features
--------
This patch adds some minor functionality to J. J. Squawkers.


* It extends the Free Play option in J. J. Squawkers to play through the normal attract mode sequence, instead of sitting on a static title screen.
* The attract cycle has also been modified to show the story and alternate title screen more often.
* The changes from the "jjsquawk" set, where the tree at the start does not drop explosive nuts, can be enabled by holding A + B when starting a game. This obsoletes the "jjsquawk" and "jjsquawko" set differences.

Instructions
------------
Apply the IPS patches to fe2001001.u3 and fe2001002.u4, from either original set, then burn to ROMs of the appropriate size.

This patch probably works on the various copy boards.

Source?
-------
This is a binary release, as the source is intertwined with another project
that is not going to be shared.

Partial relevant source has been included, but it will not assemble on its own, and no Makefile has been provided.
